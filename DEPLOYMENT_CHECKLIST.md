# Find-A-Hand Netlify Deployment Checklist

## ✅ COMPLETED FIXES

### 1. Asset Path Fixes
- [x] **Fixed all HTML asset links**: Changed all paths to use `/public/` (with leading slash)
- [x] **Updated CSS references**: All CSS files now use `/public/css/...`
- [x] **Updated image references**: All images now use `/public/images/...`
- [x] **Fixed JavaScript references**: Removed `./` prefixes and duplicate references

### 2. JavaScript API URL Fixes
- [x] **Updated hardcoded localhost URLs**: Replaced `http://localhost:5000` with `CONFIG.API_BASE_URL`
- [x] **Fixed my-handyman-profile.js**: Updated profile image and portfolio image URLs
- [x] **Verified config.js**: Properly handles localhost vs production URLs

### 3. Netlify Configuration
- [x] **Updated netlify.toml**: Added custom redirects for all HTML pages
- [x] **Static asset serving**: Configured `/public/*` redirects
- [x] **Multi-page app support**: Each route now maps to its corresponding HTML file
- [x] **Fallback routing**: Added SPA-like fallback for unmatched routes
- [x] **Publish directory**: Set to `frontend` (not `frontend/views`)

### 4. File Structure Verification
- [x] **All HTML files exist**: 15 HTML files in `frontend/views/` + 1 in `frontend/`
- [x] **All CSS files exist**: 6 CSS files in `frontend/public/css/`
- [x] **All JS files exist**: 8 JS files in `frontend/views/`
- [x] **All images exist**: Images in `frontend/public/images/`

## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### 1. Backend Deployment (Required)
Your Express backend must be deployed separately since Netlify only serves static files.

**Recommended platforms:**
- Railway (already configured in config.js)
- Render
- Heroku
- DigitalOcean App Platform

**Environment variables needed:**
- `MONGO_URI` - Your MongoDB connection string
- `JWT_SECRET` - Your JWT secret key
- `NODE_ENV=production`

### 2. Frontend Deployment (Netlify)
1. **Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify**
2. **Build settings:**
   - Build command: `echo "No build required"`
   - Publish directory: `frontend`
3. **Environment variables:**
   - No environment variables needed for frontend (all config is in config.js)

### 3. Domain Configuration
1. **Custom domain** (optional): Configure in Netlify dashboard
2. **SSL certificate**: Automatically provided by Netlify
3. **DNS settings**: Update if using custom domain

## 🔧 VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

### Before Deployment
- [ ] Backend is deployed and accessible
- [ ] API_BASE_URL in config.js points to your live backend
- [ ] All static assets are in correct locations
- [ ] No hardcoded localhost URLs remain
- [ ] All file paths use `/public/...` (with leading slash)

### After Deployment
- [ ] Homepage loads correctly
- [ ] All CSS styles are applied
- [ ] All images display properly
- [ ] Navigation between pages works
- [ ] API calls work (login, signup, etc.)
- [ ] File uploads work (if backend supports them)

## 🐛 COMMON ISSUES & SOLUTIONS

### 1. Broken Images
**Problem**: Images not loading
**Solution**: Ensure all image paths use `/public/images/...`

### 2. API Errors
**Problem**: Frontend can't connect to backend
**Solution**: 
- Verify backend is deployed and accessible
- Check API_BASE_URL in config.js
- Ensure CORS is configured on backend

### 3. 404 Errors on Direct Links
**Problem**: Direct links to pages return 404
**Solution**: Netlify redirects are configured in netlify.toml

### 4. CSS Not Loading
**Problem**: Styles not applied
**Solution**: Ensure all CSS paths use `/public/css/...`
